Barcode4J is a flexible generator for barcodes written in Java and available under the Apache License v2.0. Features

### Forked from [Sourceforge barcode4j](https://sourceforge.net/p/barcode4j/):

Barcode4j was originally developed by Jeremias MÃ¤rki and Marc Guillemot with code available on Sourceforge under Apache License V2.0.

It's not been updated in some time so this fork was made with the intention of merging in the various changes that people have tried to add over the years.

There is [another barcode4j on github](https://github.com/jeremycrosbie/barcode4j) but it's not being maintained and the svn history was not maintained.

This fork has the following goals:

- [x] Keeping the svn history
- [ ] Pulling in various svn patches and git merge requests
- [ ] Enabling continuous integration
- [ ] Adding Test Coverage
- [ ] Move to standard maven project structure
- [ ] Publish build artifacts to maven central
