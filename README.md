Barcode4J is a flexible generator for barcodes written in Java and available under the Apache License v2.0. Features

## Forked from [Sourceforge barcode4j](https://sourceforge.net/p/barcode4j/):

Barcode4j was originally developed by Jeremias MÃ¤rki and Marc Guillemot with code available on Sourceforge under Apache License v2.0.

It's not been updated in some time so this fork was made with the intention of merging in the various changes that people have tried to add over the years.

There is [another barcode4j on github](https://github.com/jeremycrosbie/barcode4j) but it's not being maintained and the svn history was not maintained.

This fork has the following goals:

 - [x] Keeping the svn history
 - [x] Enabling continuous integration for multiple Java versions
 - [x] Move to standard maven project structure (#85: Ant was removed in [102cd44](https://github.com/SingingBush/barcode4j/commit/102cd448e44961859265820be7347956b1b608e7))
 - [x] Publish build artifacts to maven central [singingbush group on maven.org](https://search.maven.org/search?q=com.singingbush)
 - [x] Support latest JDK versions (Java 1.8 is supported up to version 2.4.0 but **version 2.5 and above will require JDK 11 or above**)
 - [x] Add JPMS support (from 2.2.3 _Automatic-Module-Name_ is defined in the manifest of each published jar, **version 2.5 and above will use _module-info.java_**)
 - [x] Add support for Aztec barcodes (**in version 2.4.0 and above**, See: #91)
 - [x] Support GraalVM Native Image (changes were needed to allow barcode4j to be AOT compiled for use with [GraalVM](https://www.graalvm.org/) and/or [Quarkus](https://quarkus.io/))
 - [x] Remove dependency on Avalon-Framework (**in version 2.3.0 and above**, Avalon was retired years ago. See: #15)
 - [x] Improve Test Coverage (this is ongoing but better than it was)
 - [x] Publish JaCoCo report results
 - [x] Add static analysis ([SonarCloud](https://sonarcloud.io/summary/overall?id=barcode4j), CodeQL, and [Qodana](https://qodana.cloud/projects/ALj9x))
 - [x] Add an XSD that can be used by users of the library that use xml to define barcodes (eg: using the FOP extension).
 - [ ] Pulling in various svn patches and git merge requests
 - [ ] Either remove or update the Saxon code to support the latest Saxon EE version**

** Support for Saxon was never published to Maven central before and these days Saxonica ship 3 versions (Saxon-HE, Saxon-PE, and Saxon-EE). The first of which (Home Edition) is available via maven central but the _net.sf.saxon.style.ExtensionElementFactory_ class that is required is not available. Saxon EE is now available via Saxonica's maven repository so it may be able to revive the code to use Saxon 11 or 12. If this proves to be a pain then the related code will be removed.

## Artifacts are published to maven central:

```xml
    <dependency>
        <groupId>com.singingbush</groupId>
        <artifactId>barcode4j</artifactId>
        <version>2.4.0</version>
    </dependency>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>com.singingbush</groupId>
        <artifactId>barcode4j-xalan</artifactId>
        <version>2.4.0</version>
    </dependency>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>com.singingbush</groupId>
        <artifactId>barcode4j-xgc</artifactId>
        <version>2.4.0</version>
    </dependency>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>com.singingbush</groupId>
        <artifactId>barcode4j-fop-ext</artifactId>
        <version>2.4.0</version>
    </dependency>
```

## Compatibility with the original barcode4j:

For the most part any V2 release should be a simple migration. There are some small changes between minor versions so please see the following notes on compatibility.

### V2.2.* (drop in replacement):

This fork should work as a drop in replacement of `net.sf.barcode4j:barcode4j:2.1` for most users. Please note however that the original was a fat-jar that included classes that are now in the `barcode4j-ant`, `barcode4j-cli`, `barcode4j-servlet`, and `barcode4j-xalan` sub-modules. The singingbush barcode4j is more aligned to the [barcode4j-light](https://search.maven.org/search?q=a:barcode4j-light) package that was last released in 2008.

That said, if you've been using `net.sf.barcode4j:barcode4j:2.1` then switching to the latest `com.singingbush:barcode4j:2.+` should simply be a case of choosing the dependencies you require. In most cases this is likely to be a combination of `com.singingbush:barcode4j:2.+` and `com.singingbush:barcode4j-fop-ext:2.+`.

Initially the project will continue to be a compatible drop-in replacement for existing use of `net.sf.barcode4j:barcode4j:2.1`:

 - The v2.* releases will continue to have the existing _org.krysalis.barcode4j_ package names.
 - The _barcode4j_, _barcode4j-fop-ext_, _barcode4j-xgc_ and _barcode4j-xalan_ artifacts are published to maven central.
 - The 2.2.3 release supports JDK 1.7 and above (from 2.3.0 JDK 8 is the minimum).

### V2.3.* - V2.5.* (should be drop in replacement, possibly minor changes):

 - The 2.3.1 release supports JDK 1.8 and above
 - Drop all uses of the now defunct Avalon Framework. See [issue #15](https://github.com/SingingBush/barcode4j/issues/15), previously used imports from `org.apache.avalon.framework.configuration` should instead now use the `org.krysalis.barcode4j.configuration` alternatives
 - Remove the Ant build. Maven is used exclusively for builds
 - 2.4.0 adds support for Aztec barcodes as long as `com.google.zxing:core` is available. (this used to be *compile* scope but is now set as *provided* so you will need to add the dependency if you wish to use Aztec or QR Codes)
 - 2.5.0 drops JDK 1.8 support. JDK 11 is now the minimum supported version. JPMS is now done using a `module-info.java` rather than simply defining an _Automatic-Module-Name_. Tests that had previously used Javax XML bind are now using Jakarta.

### V3 (planned changes):

In version 3 the project will continue to be compatible for the most part. Older JDK's won't be supported but most users will not be affected.

The only changes required by users will be to change import paths to the newer package name:

 - Package names will be updated to _com.singingbush.barcode4j_ equivalent
 - Drop support for JDK 11 (support JDK 17 and above)
 - Saxon support will be updated to work with the latest Saxon EE ([Saxonica](https://www.saxonica.com/) now have a Maven repository for Saxon EE)
 - Support Java modules (JPMS) via proper use of _module-info.java_ files in the source

## Build

### Maven (in future the project will only support maven)

```
mvn package
```
