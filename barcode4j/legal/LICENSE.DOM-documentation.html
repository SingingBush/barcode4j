    <p>This formulation of W3C's notice and license became active on December 31 
      2002. This version removes the copyright ownership notice such that this license 
      can be used with materials other than those owned by the W3C, moves information 
      on style sheets, DTDs, and schemas to the <a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/IPR-FAQ">Copyright FAQ</a>, reflects 
      that ERCIM is now a host of the W3C, includes references to this specific dated 
      version of the license, and removes the ambiguous grant of "use". See the <a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/copyright-documents-19990405">older 
        formulation</a> for the policy prior to this date. Please see our <a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/IPR-FAQ">Copyright FAQ</a> for common 
      questions about using materials from our site, such as the translating or 
      annotating specifications. Other questions about this notice can be directed to
