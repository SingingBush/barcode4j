  Some user accessible points in this software package should be considered
  "beta-dev" . This means that the developer team is not investing 
  _any_ effort AT THIS TIME to make the CVS code work releases for these parts.
  This software will continue to be released as "beta-dev" for developers 
  until its code, schemas, and APIs are considered stable.
  
  The Krysalis development team understands the importance of reliable
  software as well protecting user investments through the creation of
  a solid development platform that doesn't change. On the other hand, 
  the Krysalis project is a pioneer in many fields. Most of the technologies 
  it uses are at a "working draft" phase only, even partially during beta stages,
  if the beta cycle has proved it necessary.
  Thus, reliability cannot be guaranteed before the software achieves 
  its "final" status.
  
  Until then, no effort will be provided to guarantee functionality
  for any parts considered alpha or beta.
  
  You have been warned.
